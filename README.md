# TranslateBot
Animatronic language translating robot
Step 1. On start the Tbot says, “Hi. I’m Tbot. I can translate English to your desired language. Pick a language.”

Step 2. Pick a language out of the supported languages for further interaction. The default language is set to Kannada. (Or the previous choice, if in a cycle)

Step 3. Speak what you want to translate. The bot will repeat what you have said in the desired language.
  (The bot's eyes follow face1 while listening, and face2 while speaking the translated version (OpenCV))
  At this point, you can even change the language by saying “Change Language”.  Control shifts to step 2.

Step 4. If you want to quit, say “Bye” or “Stop” in step 3. The bot shuts down.
